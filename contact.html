<h1>Let's meet <i>& reimagine the web</i></h1>
<p>Whether you're more of an email person, or twitter addict, I really want us to be in touch. Tell me your story. Feed me with your project. Because my passion for the web is not limited to design, I'm sure we can find thousands ways to collaborate with each other.</p>
