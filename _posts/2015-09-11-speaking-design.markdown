Last week, I was invited to talk about [Design Systems](https://24ways.org/2012/design-systems/) at [AQ](http://www.aqworks.com)'s very own meetup: [Ride the Lightning](https://www.facebook.com/events/399500366913192/).

I love to talk about the web. I don't think there are many topics I enjoy discussing more than the web. I think it is fundamentally healthy to discuss all things about public spaces; the web being one of them.

Later at night, I realised that after my 20 minutes long presentation, no one really challenged my thoughts. The room was full of some of the smartest designers, developers & entrepreneurs in Tokyo and still, I got nothing but pats on the back. Why is that?

Well, though it's tempting to think that the idea of building Design Systems is so great that the design community remains undivided, it is also possible to think that we rarely get to confront each other because we all think the same.

Or maybe not. Just a thought. Just another question for future me to try to answer.

**Do we all think the same?**
