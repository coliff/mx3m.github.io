excerpt: "After 2 years in Dubai, I got the opportunity to go and work for an awesome design studio in central Tokyo called [AQ Works](www.aqworks.com). "I'm thrilled" would be an understatement.

Time to pack up. Time for me to leave Dubai. Living here has been a strange experience. Culture and work wise, it's been a shock. I've been bored, excited, happy, angry, frustrated, bored again. 

But starting my adult life here has been a rewarding experience nonetheless. Two years ago, I came here with less than $1000 in my pocket, got a job and spent the rest of my time wondering what I really wanted to do with my life. 

Dubai gave me an answer. By pointing at me all the things I didn't want to see or do anymore, I finally found out what I could see myself doing for a living. 

And now I'm great. I have a purpose. I guess I really had to come here to figure some stuff out. It's probably when your environment is not ideal for you, as a person, that you can ask yourself the good questions and set priorities on what really matters. 

*So I'm going back to Japan!*

To be honest, this wasn't expected. Thing is, I didn't want to go back for the sake of being in Japan. I did that in the past and career wise, that definitely wasn't the best move possible. 

The plan was to go back to France and keep doing my stuff from there. Until I reached out to [Jean Snow](http://jeansnow.net), a talented and hyper-active guy I follow on Twitter to ask him for some advices. He replied almost instantly and redirected me to [AQ Works](www.aqworks.com). He said these guys are the best to work with and that they're probably looking for someone like me. 

It was early jan; I sent my best wishes to them and offered my services. Long story short, we all got slightly excited and decided that I was joining them for a 3 months freelance mission from next March. 

The best thing with this plan is that I don't even care they're in Tokyo. They could be in Dubai, I actually wouldn't mind. 

Going back to Japan is the cherry on top. And what a f* great cake this is.
