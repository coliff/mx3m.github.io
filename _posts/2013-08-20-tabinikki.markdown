Long before [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org) came to life, I've always thought that Wordpress, despite being a great CMS, was a little bit too complicated for most of the people. Many themes out there offer more than you can expect: columns, plugins, widgets, 3 or 4 differents layouts for posts/pages, and so on. 

What happened to those simple, content-focused themes that used to be quite popular a few years back? Sometimes, you may not want to spend your whole week-end setting up your new Wordpress blog. You just want to install a simple template, customize a picture and start writing.

With that in mind, I created **Tabinikki**, a simple responsive theme for bloggers. This theme is available for download on [Github](https://github.com/m3xm/Tabinikki).
