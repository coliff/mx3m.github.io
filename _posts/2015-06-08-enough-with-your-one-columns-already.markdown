<span class="dropcap">D</span>esigning for the web in 2015 is designing for an undefined space. The web as a cross-platform language is spoken by an infinity of devices, past and future. And that's great because it makes the web even stronger and more universal than it's ever been. But it may have made us designers clueless and scared.

We have erected mobile-first as a dominant philosophy among design practices. We have made mobile the decision-making prism through which we make things for the web, replacing the desktop prism which came before it.

I feel that the responsive web has given us safe, sensible defaults at the expense of richer looking layouts. One-column layouts have become so widely adopted by so many designers at the same time, that I grew tired of them. Bold and big type surrounded by nothing but white space and stacks of meaningless divs. That's what these websites look like to me now. Especially those I designed myself. They bore me to death.

**Design is a game, and I don't think designers who avoid the ball are really playing it.**

There just can't be a unique answer to all the questions raised by this infinity of devices we haven't even created yet. The *responsive web* always meant more layouts. And sure, that meant more work for us. But that work is worth it: it's the promise to make people's experience with the web perfectly relevant and more interesting every time.

I have seen enough clean one-column layout for now. Perhaps I should hang out more on [yahoo.co.jp](http://www.yahoo.co.jp). Enjoy the old wide web before it's too late.
