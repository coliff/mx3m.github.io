excerpt: "I'm not a writer. English is not even my native language so what the heck am I doing here? Well, in my quest to become a web-designer, I noticed that the more I could talk about it, the more links, tips, tricks I could share, the closer I was getting to my goal. Writing helps at so many different levels. It really does."

## Writing helps me to process learnings
That's common sense. Writing helps us to process whatever we're learning. That's why (you and) I had to copy everything that teachers were reading us out between 6 and 18 years old. Well, at 27 years old, I hope this trick still works fine.

## Writing helps me to focus
Writing is so hard. I need to think a lot about what I want to say, and how I can say it in a logical way. Writing is a pure design process: form and substance. And concentration is key. Because if you stop being focused ten seconds, you are losing breadcrumbs, and you then have to do it again. 

## Writing helps me to write (duh!)
Well, here's something more about me: I don't use *Lorem Ipsum* for anything else than a dummy blog post in my designs. I design with content. Designing placeholders is not my thing at all! And you know how it is. Clients or partners don't always work their content on time. They want to see how it looks first, and once they finally feel it's real, they give you something to work with. I don't blame them. We all have billions things to do everydays. 

My solution is to write content anyways! It won't necessarily be the tone they want but whatever; at least, my design are ready for real words.

So here I go. Let's see where all this carry me.
