My friend **Joris** asked me to design and develop a simple one-page portfolio to showcase his latest work. He's an awesome video editor and film director who's been working for a couple of huge ad agencies for the past 3 years. We went for something very minimalist and showcased his best work using an asymmetrical grid. The website is also responsive and hence works perfectly on tablets and smartphones.
