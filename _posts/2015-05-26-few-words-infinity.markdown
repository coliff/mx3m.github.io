I'm going to give this a go.

Right before I sleep, I usually have this weird conversation with myself where I ask my inside me a ton of silly questions. I long for some quality answers but they never really come.

One of the question that's been coming a lot these days is: "what's the one thing that could make me a better designer?".

*Coding better. Taking up some new side projects. Writing about design.* I made a list, you see.

This website is a tentative to nail all of these three things at once.

So I'm going to give this a go. Now â€” where do I start?
