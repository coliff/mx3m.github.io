excerpt: "There's a lot to say about Dubai. Good and bad. If you ever lived or live here, you know that no one feels indifferent about this city. I met people who loved it, I met people who deeply hated it. But I never met anyone who didn't really have a forged and strong opinion about it."

That's it. I'm leaving next week and I wanted to draw a quick portrait of Dubai as I experienced it. If you know me, you won't be surprised to hear that I haven't been a huge fan of this city. That's quite a stupid thing to say though because no one here has been harsh to me; I met some really nice people, made friends, made money (and all have been duly spent, thank you shopping).</div>

<figcaption><h4>Dubai Marina</h4>This is where I lived. A very nice looking expat ghetto where it feels good to walk around. Lots of restaurants, yachts and expensives cars.</figcaption></figure><div class="container"><p>Expats in Dubai have the good life. Some of us are spoiled. I was spoiled. An example, you said? Everything gets delivered. If it's for sale, it gets delivered: groceries, food, furnitures, cigarettes, water... Give a call to your guy, and it's already on its way!</p><p>Although quite expensive, most of the apartments/houses I've seen or been at here look nice. I was still a student back when I first arrived here, the day I landed a job, I got an apartment in a residence with pool, gym, convenient store, cleaning, restaurants... For a 25 years old european boy, that's insane.</p><p>I made friends my age here driving cars my mother can't even afford after 40 years of hard labour. I'm not surprised anymore to see Mazerattis, Lamborghinis, Ferraris or Porsche every morning on my way to work. That's a city of money.</p><p>Money is at the heart of Dubai, so deeply anchored you can feel dizzy times to times. But don't get me wrong, I have no problem with that. That might have excited me at one point.</p></div>

<figcaption><h4>Jumeirah Beach</h4>I thought, being a muslim country, authorities would be rather strict when it comes to clothing but not really actually. Bikinis, tight shorts, everything seems to be pretty much tolerated.</figcaption></figure><div class="container"><p>My day to day life became so confortable that I eventually got used to it. I became lazy. I didn't want to do the dishes anymore because an helper was coming every now and then to clean it. I didn't want to take the metro anymore because taxis are affordable and convenient. I didn't even change any light bulbs (the built-in ones, in my ceiling) in my apartment cause guess what, someone else could do it for me. The city is made in such a way that one can spend his days without lifting a single finger.</p><p>As a matter of fact, no one ever walks. There's nowhere to walk anyway. It's a city for cars. Big cars, preferably.</p><p>But it's not Dubai's fault entirely. I'm not blaming a city or its inhabitants for my behavior, or my lack of behavior. It just occured that my lifestyle here made me lazy. And I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one, or even the worst of us.</p>

<figcaption><h4>A work in progress city</h4>The whole place is always under construction. After the crisis hit, a lot of construction sites were abandoned; some areas look desolated.</figcaption></figure><p>Everyone come to Dubai for the same exact reason. From the construction worker making hundred bucks a month to the corporate CEO making hundred of thousands, everyone came here with money in mind. Money, and stability.</p><p>I've made a lot of Lebanese and Syrian friends over here that confess easily that Dubai feels like home now although it isn't and never will be. They all love their countries but don't even consider going back. After all, they have all the reasons in the world not to do so! Dubai is a haven of peace in a very complex region. I'm glad I could meet all these fine people, become friend and learn from them. It somewhat changed my vision of the arab world forever and it wouldn't have been possible otherwise.</p></div>

<figcaption><h4>From inside Madinat Jumeirah</h4>Dubai is incredible. Dubai sometimes look stunning. Dubai is grand but still lacks authenticity. What you see in the picture is a whole ancient madinat that has been recreated to amuse residents and tourists. I spent quite a few funny evenings there.</figcaption></figure><div class="container"><p>But beyond the characters and people I met here, I encountered boredom. Boredom like I never experienced. Because there **are** things to do here from shopping to the numerous beaches along the peninsula and desert treks, karting; even <a href="http://www.theplaymania.com/skidubai/welcome">skiing</a>! But gosh, passed the first exciting 3 weeks, my life became such a routine. The same bars, in the same hotels (most of the alcohol licenced bars are located in hotels here) followed by the same week-ends at the mall: countless hours wasted in buying stuff I don't need, wandering in places I don't care about.</p><p>I managed to get myself lazy and bored! I never watched so many movies in my entire life. My girlfriend and I litterally spent entire week-ends seating on our couch, watching movies and series, playing silly games on our phones. After one year, we didn't want to go out anymore. What for? Spend more money? Go to a brunch? And summers...</p></div>

<figcaption><h4>Dubai Creek and its vintage boats</h4>Creek and Deira are authentic neighbourhoods with huge Indian and Pakistanese communities. They're nice places to roam during winter when the weather is not too hot. But it's definitely worth seeing during Ramadan as well!</figcaption></figure><div class="container"><p>Summers last for 5 to 6 month. It is endless. It starts beginning of april at 36°C and climbs up to 50°C in august. There's absolutely nothing to do during summers that don't irritate me. The air is so humid people can barely breathe. There were times in july, august and september where going out of my building felt like walking in hell. The sea's water is so hot, one of my friend almost collapsed trying to get some refreshment.</p><p>Bars' outdoors are closed, some beaches are closed. It is unhealthy and highly unadvised to stay outside for too long, and yet construction worker keep doing what they do, working 10 to 12 hours a day, for peanuts. Who's going to complain? Union are automatically dismantled and protesters sent back to their home countries without notice.</p><p>The irony is that during summer, 90% of the Dubai population is lacking vitamin D, the same vitamin you get from being exposed under the sun. No one goes under the sun; and no one goes out at night too cause it doesn't make any difference anyways.</div>

<figcaption><h4>Hidden beauty in the Old Dubai</h4>The Old Dubai is quite the attraction here. At least, it was for me. Radically different from Marina, the place feels way more authentic and lively.</figcaption></figure><div class="container"><p>So I'm leaving this place I less appreciated for its charms than for its people. Dubai is magical, extraordinary, oversized, safe but also sad, unfair and brutally hot.</p>

I don't know whether I'll ever come back but I definitely don't regret I spent 2 years of my life here. I learned a lot about life, about myself and in the process, well, I've been able to watch a huge load of movies.
