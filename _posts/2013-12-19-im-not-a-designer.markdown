Answering to that question is not easy. It's not only about the title per se. It's just that I'm not the typical graphic artist who evolved into a brilliant solving problem designer. How my young career started is more complicated than that.

Long story short, I went to a business school, got a masters in marketing and finally got my first job as an Account Exec for a big advertising firm. 

Client services. Yeah, I did that for a year. Maybe more. Definitely more. And in the creative industry, one knows that account handlers are not perceived as creative genius at all. In the creative industry, you'd better be "creative" than "industry" otherwise you're just a fucking moron. 

I suffered from that. Not hunger suffer. Not war suffer, just an innocent little ego pain that my mum didn't warn me about. Well, truth is, I wasn't very good at what I was doing. I couldn't focus on my timeline sheets more than 30s. I couldn't speak to my client nicely. I couldn't back up my fellow creatives during meetings. I could barely sell ideas, but only when I was genuinely convinced that they were the right ideas. That rarely happened. I was not bad. I was just mediocre. 

Note for myself: I'd rather be bad than mediocre. 

So I naturally quit my job. And when I did that, early 2013, I didn't even know what I was going to do. Then I remembered these days when I was hacking things around for my friends. These teen days when you have more time than you can handle? I was doing small websites on Dreamweaver (design mode baby). I enjoyed doing that. 

Then I also remembered my first internship. I was also hacking things around for a small (and unfortunately not very successful) e-commerce company in Tokyo. The job they gave me, which was primarily focused on answering customers' emails was only keeping me busy for half a day. I had the other half for myself and suggested that I could probably try to improve their sales. How? I had no clue. I started reading about e-commerce, conversion rate and how good design could solve a few of their problems. Mostly stuff that you don't learn at a business school.

I did research. I read. I educated myself. I started thinking of ways to improve their business model through design, without even knowing it. I loved it. Without any skills, I managed to redesign their product page, their checkout process, their homepage and a few other things. 

Now it's easy for me to say that what I did at the time was not very good. I may have solved a few problems but in the process created a few others. But damn, I enjoyed the feeling. 

With that in mind, I decided to go deeper and learn more about one of the rare thing I actually enjoyed doing: solving problem through design. I had left my job, I had a lot of time in my hands but not a lot of money: I subscribed to a few podcasts, read again, got a Treehouse membership, learned how to code web pages properly. 

After a while, I thought that **designer** might be a good fit for me. A path. Was I legitimate enough to go that way? I was 26, no related degree whatsoever, a bullshit portfolio full of nothing; who could possibly hire me to do their design? 

So I worked on a few personal projects. I released some. I kept most for myself. Then I started getting a few requests from my friend, or family, who were all interested by what I was trying to achieve. That felt nice, and comforting. 

But that wasn't the real deal.

The real deal is client work. Real client work. People who come to you with a challenge and trust you with their stuff.

This is what I'm currently working on. Cause I have clients. Happy clients it seems. But still, I just cannot be that self-proclaimed "designer" and expect people to take my word for it. So what does it take? 

My two cents: it takes result. And it's just too early for me to say it worked or not. But it'll come. Until then, well, I'm not a designer.
