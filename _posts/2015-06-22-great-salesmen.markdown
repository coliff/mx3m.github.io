There's this short bit in [Zero to One](http://zerotoonebook.com) I really liked where [Peter Thiel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) writes about how great salesmen never reveal themselves as such.

Without surprise, he mentions [Elon Musk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk), as an example, to make his point: Musk is a cool valley dude, he wears t-shirts and Converse. He smiles a lot and although he probably doesn't think like anyone else, he speaks like us. He's called a genius, an innovator, an entrepreneur, [the world's raddest man](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html) and the list goes on.

Musk [managed to close a 2.6 billion dollars contract](http://qz.com/281619/what-it-took-for-elon-musks-spacex-to-disrupt-boeing-leapfrog-nasa-and-become-a-serious-space-company/) with NASA. Although that simply was NASA's largest contract ever, Musk is still rarely ever described as an amazing salesman. Maybe the best the valley has ever seen?

Great salesmen wear different masks and different titles to gain our trust. Think of all these tricky titles we came up with: Consultant, Account Manager, Asset Manager, Investment Banker, Financial Advisor, Apple Genius... Sometimes, it gets confusing to the point where it's hard to determine who's who.

Peter Thiel, puts it this way: "look around you, if you don't see a salesman, chances are: you are the salesman".

I've been thinking a lot about this last quote. Would I be okay with that â€“ being the salesman? [Are great designer necessarily great salesmen](http://muledesign.com/2014/09/13-ways-designers-screw-up-client-presentations)?

Food for thought.
