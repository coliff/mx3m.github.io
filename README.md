Well, this is my personal website. You shouldn't copy any of its content (including pictures and text) before asking authorization. The code is made public in case it helps fellow designers to get the hang of Jekyll. I made a [free Jekyll theme](https://github.com/m3xm/hikari-for-Jekyll) if that's what you're looking for. It's open source too, so you can do whatever you want with it, I won't mind!
