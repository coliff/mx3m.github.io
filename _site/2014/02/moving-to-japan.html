<p>Time to pack up. Time for me to leave Dubai. Living here has been a strange experience. Culture and work wise, it's been a shock. I've been bored, excited, happy, angry, frustrated, bored again.</p>

<p>But starting my adult life here has been a rewarding experience nonetheless. Two years ago, I came here with less than $1000 in my pocket, got a job and spent the rest of my time wondering what I really wanted to do with my life.</p>

<p>Dubai gave me an answer. By pointing at me all the things I didn't want to see or do anymore, I finally found out what I could see myself doing for a living.</p>

<p>And now I'm great. I have a purpose. I guess I really had to come here to figure some stuff out. It's probably when your environment is not ideal for you, as a person, that you can ask yourself the good questions and set priorities on what really matters.</p>

<p><em>So I'm going back to Japan!</em></p>

<p>To be honest, this wasn't expected. Thing is, I didn't want to go back for the sake of being in Japan. I did that in the past and career wise, that definitely wasn't the best move possible.</p>

<p>The plan was to go back to France and keep doing my stuff from there. Until I reached out to <a href="http://jeansnow.net">Jean Snow</a>, a talented and hyper-active guy I follow on Twitter to ask him for some advices. He replied almost instantly and redirected me to <a href="www.aqworks.com">AQ Works</a>. He said these guys are the best to work with and that they're probably looking for someone like me.</p>

<p>It was early jan; I sent my best wishes to them and offered my services. Long story short, we all got slightly excited and decided that I was joining them for a 3 months freelance mission from next March.</p>

<p>The best thing with this plan is that I don't even care they're in Tokyo. They could be in Dubai, I actually wouldn't mind.</p>

<p>Going back to Japan is the cherry on top. And what a f* great cake this is.</p>
