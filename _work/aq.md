runin:            "AQ is simply put the smartest and friendliest group of international designers you'll ever find in Tokyo. When they decided to take me on the team, I was thrilled. I stayed with them for 4 years.<br/><br/>During my time there, I was involved in redesigning and recoding some of the key pages of AQ's website. I had a great time especially working with the amazingly talented <a class='hint' href='https://www.instagram.com/tatsushi_eto/'>Tatsushi Eto</a> who made the beautiful illustrations on AQ's Research page."
