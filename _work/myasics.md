runin:            "I was tasked to redesign the MY ASICS iOS app to introduce the <a class='hint' href='/work/exchange.html'>Exchange</a> community feature as well as bringing up to speed the latest visual language and design patterns that I had recently introduced to the MY ASICS ecosystem.<br/><br/>With this new design, the goal was to deliver a more social experience to the MY ASICS runners' training program. In addition to the coaching aspect already provided by MY ASICS, we added community tips and more in-depth personal profile options."
