description:      "Exchange is a new way for Asics runners to share running tips and learn from others. This has been an A to Z design & front-end project with the great people at AQ. I mainly focused on creating a robust pattern library for it which is already being implemented in other parts of the MY ASICS ecosystem. iOS is coming soon."
