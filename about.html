	<h1>Design, code and write <i>for a living</i></h1>
	<p>At 26, I left a nice agency job and started to build my first websites. I've been enjoying every single minute of my time since then. I'm now a 27 years old maker and I finally know what I'd like to be doing for the rest of my life. <em>That feels awesome</em>.</p>

	<p>I currently live, play and work in <strong>Dubai</strong>. I meet new people almost every day. <strong>People</strong> is my thing. People is the reason I love design. People is what gives a purpose to what I do, what we all do. <strong>I don't buy into trends that don't set people first</strong>. Not content, not users, <strong>people</strong>.</p>
	<p>I wasn't smart enough to go to an Art School. I got an MBA instead. All I have is my obsession for details, a bunch of books, and my admiration for Japanese minimalism. Oh, forgot to mention that I lived in Japan for almost two years. If I can, I'll probably spend my last days overthere.</p>
