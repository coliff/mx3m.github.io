    <p>Here's 10 things you should know about me.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I'm a front-end designer. Meaning, I design User Interfaces mainly using code like HTML, Sass, Javascript and, although definitely work in progress, Swift.</li>
      <li>I do Sketch too. Whenever possible, I like to skip that part though. Paper & code works best for me.</li>
      <li>Generally speaking, I'm not fond of websites that mess with my scrolling, or my x-axis. Please don't do that.</li>
      <li>I love lists.</li>
      <li>I live in Japan and work with <a href="http://www.aqworks.com" title="AQ">those guys</a>. It's nice here.</li>
      <li>I grew up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille" title="Marseille">Marseille</a>. It's mostly sunny throughout the year. Most of it is beautiful, like <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=marseille&espv=2&biw=1440&bih=762&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=i91pVbHfF4HymQWm-4PQCg&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&dpr=2" title="Pictures of Marseille">really beautiful</a>.</li>
      <li>I love video games. Except maybe <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=street+cleaning+simulator" title="Street Cleaning Simulation Google Results">hardcore simulations</a>.</li>
      <li>My favorite TV meal combo is cheese & wine.</li>
      <li>I studied and got a masters in Business Administration.</li>
      <li>Maybe my <a href="mailto:mathieu.mayermazzoli@gmail.com" title="Send me an email">email address</a>.</li>
