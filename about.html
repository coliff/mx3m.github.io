<p>At 26, I quit my safe but not so cosy job I didn't really enjoy doing and started making websites. I've been enjoying every single minute of my time since then. I'm now 28 and feels incredibly privileged (not to say lucky!) to be working with very talented folks at <a href="">AQ</a> for clients such as <a href="http://www.google.com/about/">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.asics.com">Asics</a> or <a href="http://www.tokyoartbeat.com/resources/doc/faq">Tokyo Art Beat</a>.</p>

	<p>I currently live, play and work in <strong>Tokyo</strong>. I sometimes give talks about design and design tools at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AQRideTheLightning">Ride The Lightning</a>, a pretty cool multilingual, monthly event hosted in our studio in Nishi-Azabu.</p>
	<p>I didn't go to Art School, which makes me a very peculiar specimen. I have an MBA and talks the business language fluently. I also have an obsession for small details which makes me kind of your worst nightmare if you're not the type of person to align layers or indent code.</p>

	<p>I work most of the time in Sublime Text or Sketch.</p>
