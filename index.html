<p>Hi, my name is Mat. I'm on a mission to help creators build successful interfaces, from desktop to mobile. I live in Tokyo. This site aims to present a short collection of my work and thoughts. I unfortunately don't update this site as often as I should but you can follow my work on the <a href="http://www.aqworks.com">AQ</a>'s website, the design studio I work at.</p>

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.categories.work %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}"><strong>{{ post.title }}</strong>, {{ post.excerpt }}<span class="arrow">&rsaquo;</span></a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
