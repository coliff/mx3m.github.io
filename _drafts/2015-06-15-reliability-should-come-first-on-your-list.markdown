Last week, I deleted [Sunrise](https://calendar.sunrise.am/) from all my devices, with no exception. I'll tell you why in a minute.

### Priorities

I had the chance to mentor a few early stage start-ups with [this guy](http://www.twitter.com/cpalmieri). In a nutshell, design mentoring means we (try to) remind startup teams what really matters. A lot of times you see, they're so busy building they can forget what they're building in the first place.

It's fun. I quite like these moments because for once I get to do my job without any tools in front of me. It's just a conversation. When I'm lucky, I get to draw some lines on a whiteboard. That's cool too.

Most of the start-ups we work with during those sessions have plenty of questions for us. They seem happy to get some strangers' eyes on what they're doing – get some design help and critique. Plus –pretty good perk– it's free.

I'm getting this sense that a lot of them are concerned about how their product looks, whether the onboarding is working, if feature X would be improved by pushing feature Y to a future sprint. All of this is great. They get the feedback they want, maybe improve their product over the next few days, maybe not.

What I don't sense is how deeply they value **reliability**. It doesn't come up. I know, [Chris](http://www.twitter.com/cpalmieri) and I are *just* designers so it's not like speaking to us about these things makes sense right away. Fair enough.

But I'm a curious man. Where does reliability sit in their list of priorities?

I value impeccable UX and I sure think that delighting users is a good way of keeping them around. But to get there, there's only one constant: **your app needs to work**.

Every app has a single, central promise, and it needs to keep that promise.

**Your app needs to be working at all times. If it fails to do that, alert your user and tell them what's wrong**.

This should be on top of our priority list.

### Crash resilience

If, like me, you started browsing the web in the 90's, you probably did so from a PC with Netscape or Internet Explorer running on Windows 95. Back then, I remember being extremely resilient to bugs and crashes.

Blue screen? Damn it, let's reboot. Browser freeze? Page's not loading? We'd better Ctrl-Alt-Del and see what's going on. We were fighters, then for a few years after things got better, survivors. Nothing scared us and we had close-to-unlimited patience.

Twenty years later, how patient are we with things that don't work? How many tweets are being posted whenever Facebook is down? Top web products became so good that, in the span of a decade, our resilience towards bugs, crashes, malfunctions, dropped considerably. We have stopped assuming that, somehow, technology is unreliable (although [it really is](https://medium.com/message/everything-is-broken-81e5f33a24e1)). Confort made us all extremely demanding. Innocently, we are raising the barrier for any new tech startup to enter the market.

### Employee of the month

Sometimes last week, in the bus that drives me from Shibuya Station to our offices in Nishi Azabu, I opened Slack and noticed that a client meeting was going on. I remember being invited to that meeting but somehow, that meeting was not anywhere in my Sunrise calendar to see. Not when I triple checked in that bus, not when I double checked in the morning, not when I checked at night before going to bed. That meeting simply disappeared from my calendar.

Not only did I just suddenly disqualify for *employee of the month* but I also felt extremely angry at Sunrise. Everybody's calendar worked and all of them were at that meeting. And I wasn't. I told everyone that my calendar failed me but, echo of the past, it probably sounded like "my dog ate my homework". It didn't really matter that my app failed me because I'm free to choose my own tools, and I chose poorly.

I believe that the ecosystem of apps we build around ourselves can define us as much as any other thing we share online. At the end of the day, we're responsible for all of that.

Later that day, a meeting that was in my calendar had actually been canceled the previous day. That was the drop.

Pissed as I was, I deleted Sunrise from my iPhone and iPad, unbookmarked it from Chrome and decided that I was done with it. I loved Sunrise but all it took was for it to fail me twice that day. It's unfair. Maybe it was the Google API failing. Maybe it was my iPhone's. Sunrise failed me in that it didn't even noticed that something was going wrong. So I blamed Sunrise. No excuse allowed. Not to me. Not to Sunrise.

It's such a cruel world.
