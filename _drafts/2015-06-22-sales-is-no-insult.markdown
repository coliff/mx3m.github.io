In [Zero to One](http://zerotoonebook.com), [Peter Thiel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) writes about how great salesmen never reveal themselves as such. Good salesmen, for him, are masters of disguise. Without surprise, he mentions [Elon Musk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk), as an example, to make his point: Musk is a cool valley dude, he wears t-shirts and speaks casually. He's called a genius, an innovator, entrepreneur... The list goes on.

That guy closed a 1.6 billion dollars contract with NASA and rarely is he ever described as an amazing salesman.

### Invisibility cloaks

Consultant, Account Manager, Asset Manager, Investment Banker, Financial Advisor, Apple Genius, Estate Agent... **They're invisibility cloaks**. We're running out of titles to hide our salesmen.

And for what? When did *sales* as a word become dirty enough that we wanted to hide it?

### Perverted culture

Business and sales is a perverted culture.
