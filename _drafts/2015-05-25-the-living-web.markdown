The web is so simple. Simple, yet amazingly powerful.

And still, it's not powerful enough to some.

I won't deny that I've been impressed by [what those guys at Flipboard did lately](http://engineering.flipboard.com/2015/02/mobile-web/ "60FPS on the Mobile Web").

Pardon the [Game of Thrones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones) reference, but this `canvas` stuff sounds pretty much like *Melissandre* and her king's blood weird, dark, magic. It's awesome, yeah. But scary at the same time.
