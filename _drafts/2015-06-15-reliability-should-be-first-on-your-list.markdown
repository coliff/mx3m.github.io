Last week, I deleted [Sunrise](https://calendar.sunrise.am/) from all my devices, with no exception. I'll tell you why in a minute.

I had the chance to do some early start-ups mentoring sessions with [this guy](http://www.iixii.net/). In a nutshell, design mentoring is about giving advices to very young tech startups who, more often than not, are so busy with building stuff that they forget what they're building in the first place.

It's fun. I quite like these moments because for once I get to do my job without any tool in front of me. It's just a conversation going on. When I'm lucky, I get to draw some lines on a whiteboard. That's cool too.

Most of the start-ups we work with during those sessions have plenty of questions to ask us. They're usually quite happy to get an stranger's eye on what they do â€“ get some design help and critique. It's free.

I think I'm getting this sense that a lot of them are concerned about: how their product is looking? If the onboarding is doing the job? X feature could be improved by pushing Y feature to a future sprint? All of that is great. They get the feedback they want, maybe improve their product over the next few days.

On the other hand, tech products have never been so good. I mean, look at Google Search these days. Docs. Twitter? When's the last time you saw that whale? No more Rails for them, you bet. Top web products are so good that, in the span of a decade, our resilience towards bugs, crashes, things-that-don't-friggin-work dropped considerably.

People expect things to just work, no question asked. I'm like that. I bet you are too.

Last friday, I had a series of event happening to me because of Sunrise:
