Last week, I deleted [Sunrise](https://calendar.sunrise.am/) from all my devices, with no exception. I'll tell you why in a minute.

### Priorities

I had the chance to do some early start-ups mentoring sessions with [this guy](http://www.iixii.net/). In a nutshell, design mentoring means we try to advise very young tech startups who, more often than not, are so busy with building stuff that they forget what they're building in the first place.

It's fun. I quite like these moments because for once I get to do my job without any tool in front of me. It's just a conversation going on. When I'm lucky, I get to draw some lines on a whiteboard. That's cool too.

Most of the start-ups we work with during those sessions have plenty of questions to ask us. They seem happy to get some strangers' eyes on what they do â€“ get some design help and critique. Plus, it's free.

I think I'm getting this sense that a lot of them are concerned about how their product is looking, whether the onboarding is doing, if X feature could be improved by pushing Y feature to a future sprint? All of that is great. They get the feedback they want, maybe improve their product over the next few days, maybe not.

What I don't feel is how valuable and critical is **reliability** to them. I know, [Chris](http://www.iixii.net) and I are *just* designers so it's not like speaking to us about these things makes perfect sense right away. Fair enough.

But I'm a curious man. And in their list of priorities, how tolerant are they with reliability?

### Crash resilience

I value impeccable UX and I sure think that delighting users is a good way of keeping them around but to get there, there's only one constant: **your app needs to be working**.

I think I can even go further in this thought: **your app must be working at all time and never fail, not even once, to any user**. That should be your #1 objective.

If, like me, you started browsing the web in the 90's, you probably did that from a PC with Netscape or Internet Explorer. If I'm right, all of that was running on Windows 95. Back then, I remember being extremely resilient to bugs and crashes.

Blue screen? Damn it, let's reboot. Browser freeze? Page's not loading? We'd better Ctrl-Alt-Del and see what's going on. We were fighters. Nothing scared us and we had close-to-unlimited patience.

20 years later, how patient are we with things that don't work? How many tweets are being posted whenever Facebook is down? Top web products became so good that, in the span of a decade, our resilience towards bugs, crashes, malfunctions, dropped considerably. We stopped to consider that, somehow, technology is unreliable (although [it really is](https://medium.com/message/everything-is-broken-81e5f33a24e1)). Confort made us all extremely demanding.

### Employee of the month

Sometimes last week, in the bus that drives me from Shibuya Station to our offices in Nishi Azabu, I open Slack and notice that a conversation about a meeting happening then .......... I remember being invited to that meeting but somehow, that meeting was not anywhere in my Sunrise calendar to see. Not when I triple checked in that bus, not when I double checked in the morning, not when I checked at night before going to bed. That meeting simply disappeared from my.

Not only did I just suddenly disqualify for *employee of the month* but I also feel instantly terribly sorry for what happened. Everybody's calendar worked and all of them were at that meeting. And I wasn't. And "it's not my fault" sounds like bullshit anyways.

Later that day, a meeting

Pissed as I was, I deleted Sunrise from my iPhone and iPad, unbookmarked it from Chrome and decided that I was done with it. Just like that, an app I've been using for two years was gone from my ecosystem. I loved Sunrise but all it took was for it to fail me twice that day. It's unfair. Maybe it was the Google API failing. Maybe it was my iPhone's.
