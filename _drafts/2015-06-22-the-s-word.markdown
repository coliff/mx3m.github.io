In [Zero to One](http://zerotoonebook.com), [Peter Thiel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) writes about how great salesmen never reveal themselves as such. Good salesmen, for him, are masters of disguise. Without surprise, he mentions [Elon Musk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk), as an example, to make his point: Musk is a cool valley dude, he wears t-shirts and speaks casually. He's called a genius, an innovator, entrepreneur... The list goes on.

Weird for a guy that [managed to close a 2.6 billion dollars contract](http://qz.com/281619/what-it-took-for-elon-musks-spacex-to-disrupt-boeing-leapfrog-nasa-and-become-a-serious-space-company/) with NASA. That simply was NASA's largest contract ever but even though, Musk is still rarely ever described as an amazing salesman.

### Invisibility cloaks

Consultant, Account Manager, Asset Manager, Investment Banker, Financial Advisor, Apple Genius, Estate Agent... **They're invisibility cloaks**. We're running out of titles to hide our salesmen.

And for what? Rhetorical question if you may. When did we stop to even say the word? The S word.

Well, as far as I can remember, sales has always been considered as part of "the old world". If I say "salesman", I know what you're picturing. A 40ish years old male with a suitcase. Slightly overweight. He likes liquor more than liquor likes him. His smile doesn't look so honest.

Or maybe you see something else. But that's not the point. The point is that you think that guy is dishonest. If you ever entered an interaction with him, he'd have to proove you that he's being honest first. And that's either impossible (because he's not, or because you won't believe him no matter how hard he tries) or just too difficult and time consuming.

Our default beliefs play against salesmen. Hence, how convenienent would it be for them to play another role. The role of a guide. The role of an assistant. The role of a friend. And, how long until they also play the role of a robot? How long until Siri or Cortana try to sell us stuff?

Sales masters know how to play those roles. But there are times where "hidden salesmen" can take a much more literal sense:

If, like me, you've been watching HBO's [Silicon Valley](http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley), you may remember a quick scene during which we get to peek at one of Pied Piper new competitor's offices.

The CEO of this fictional company seem to open a back door and show off his "sales ops". 20 guys or so behind black Dell PCs who all look like they're giving calls.

### Sales intention

So, one-sentence recap. We made it so hard for old-fashioned salesmen to do their jobs normally that they had to blend in and wear other masks, play other roles.

The line is now becoming so blurry that it's become harder to say who's who. Look around you, in your agency, in your start-up, wherever you might be working. Who's selling? Maybe it's clear to you but is it clear to everyone else?

[Peter Thiel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel), puts it this way: "look around you, if you don't see a salesman, chances are: you are the salesman".

And my take on it is that: it's ok to be the salesman. It can even be rewarding and rich in learnings.
