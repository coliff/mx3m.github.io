*Short one today.*

In [Zero to One](http://zerotoonebook.com), [Peter Thiel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) writes about how great salesmen never reveal themselves as such. Good salesmen, for him, are masters of disguise. Without surprise, he mentions [Elon Musk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk), as an example, to make his point: Musk is a cool valley dude, he wears t-shirts and converse, he smiles a lot and although he probably doesn't think like anyone else, he speaks like us. He's called a genius, an innovator, an entrepreneur, [the world's raddest man](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html) and the list goes on.

Musk [managed to close a 2.6 billion dollars contract](http://qz.com/281619/what-it-took-for-elon-musks-spacex-to-disrupt-boeing-leapfrog-nasa-and-become-a-serious-space-company/) with NASA. Although that simply was NASA's largest contract ever, Musk is still rarely ever described as an amazing salesman. Maybe the best the valley has ever seen?

Consultant, Account Manager, Asset Manager, Investment Banker, Financial Advisor, Apple Genius... **They're invisibility cloaks**. We're running out of titles to hide our salesmen.

And for what? Rhetorical question if you may. When did we stop to even say the word? The S word.

Who's who? The line is now so blurry.

Peter Thiel, puts it this way: "look around you, if you don't see a salesman, chances are: you are the salesman".

I'm okay being the salesman.
