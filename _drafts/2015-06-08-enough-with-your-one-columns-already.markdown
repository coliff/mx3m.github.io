Did the move towards responsive websites led us to simplify web layouts and styles? It wasn't so much that *flat* or *simple* was the thing to do. Rather, *flat* and *simple* made our life easier.

Designing for the web in 2015 is designing for an undefined space. The web as a cross-platform language is spoken by an infinity of devices, past and future. And that's great because it makes the web even stronger and more universal than it's ever been. But it made some of us clueless and scared.

We might have erected mobile-first as a dominant philosophy among design practices. Because mobile became or is becoming the first platform we listen (sic) to the web, we decided that mobile will therefore become the matrix of all our decisions. Like Desktop was the matrix for all our decisions before that.

I feel that the responsive web is sometimes designed at the expense of richer looking layouts. One-column layouts became so widely adopted, by so many designers, at the same time, that I kind of grew tired of them. Bold and big type surrounded by vacuum and stacks of meaningless divs. That's what these websites look like to me now. They bore me to death. Some of them for which I'm responsible.

**Design is a game, and I don't think designers who avoid the ball are really playing it.**

There just can't be an unique answer to all the questions raised by this infinity of devices we haven't even created yet. The *responsive web* always meant more layouts. And sure, that meant more work for us. But that work is worth it: it's the promise to make people's experience with the web perfectly relevant and more interesting every time.

I don't want to be bored by the web.
