<p>Most of my words are on Twitter but sometimes, when 140 characters just don't seem enough, I come here and add a few more lines to tell about my work or adventures. Oh, and if you're not in the mood for words, I have a <a target="_blank" href="http://m3xm.tumblr.com">board on Tumblr</a> that I mainly use to share pictures, type & art.</p>

<ul id="posts">
  {% for post in site.categories.blog %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}"><span class="date">{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &#x02014; <strong>{{ post.title }}</strong><span class="arrow">&rsaquo;</span></a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
